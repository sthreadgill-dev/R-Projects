How to Install and Use Swirl
================

## What is Swirl?

Swirl is an interactive learning package available for R. As with R
itself, it is an open source package where others may create their own
courses to be made available to download via the package. You can learn
more about the history of R refer to his blog post by Jon Calder: [Why
swirl? \| R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/01/why-swirl/)

It is one of the only formats to learn more that take place in your IDE.
So not only do you get to learn different skills in R, you get to do it
in your local environment. It is a self paced learning package offering
beginner, intermediate, and advanced lessons. If youâ€™d like to learn
